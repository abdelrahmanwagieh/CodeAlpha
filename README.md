Titanic Machine Learning Competition
This project is part of the legendary Titanic Machine Learning competition hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on various attributes such as age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

Introduction
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the Titanic collided with an iceberg and sank, resulting in the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While some factors of survival were based on luck, it is believed that certain groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this competition, participants are tasked with building a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of a passenger surviving the disaster based on their attributes.

Dataset
Participants are provided with two datasets:

train.csv: This dataset contains information about a subset of passengers, including whether they survived or not (known as the "ground truth"). This dataset is used for training machine learning models.

test.csv: This dataset contains similar information to the training set but does not include the survival outcomes. The task is to predict survival for these passengers based on the trained model.

Project Overview
This project involves the following steps:

Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Building: Building a machine learning model using the training data. In this project, a Random Forest Classifier is utilized.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on both training and testing data.

Prediction: Making predictions on the final test data and saving the results to a CSV file for submission to Kaggle.

Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. The main steps include data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
